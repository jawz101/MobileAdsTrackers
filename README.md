This blocklist is a highly-curated, small list designed to block ads and trackers used only by mobile apps.

I originally maintained the "MobileAdsTrackers" list before taking over the Adaway blocklist, which had fallen behind the rapidly evolving mobile ad ecosystem of the mid-2010s. The list is intentionally small, as many old ad companies have since been bought or shut down.

It is designed to filter device-level app traffic (e.g., via Android's Private DNS or a VPN) and must be paired with a separate ad blocker for web browsing.

To ensure the list remains efficient, I regularly remove dead domains by checking them against lists of active sites (like Cisco Umbrella's Top 1 Million).
